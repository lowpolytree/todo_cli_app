A simple command-line interface (CLI) Todo App built with Node.js. The app allows you to add, remove, list, complete, and clear tasks from a task list stored in a `tasks.json` file.

## Features:

- Mark tasks as complete.
- List all tasks with their completion status.
- Clear all tasks from the list.
- Task IDs are automatically re-indexed after a task is removed.
